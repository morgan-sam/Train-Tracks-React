<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>A map is randomly generated with an entrance and an exit. The number of tiles in row or column is shown on the top and right of the map. You must created a track that meets the required number of tracks for each row and column.</p>

<p>There are three modes: Easy (6x6), Medium (8x8) and Hard (10x10).</p>

<p>Place all the correct tracks to win. You can place an X to mark a tile that has no tracks, and a T to mark a track where you don't know the type of rail used yet. Hover over different parts of the tile to see what track you will place on left click. </p>

<h3>Controls:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Left click: places tracks</li>
<li>Right click: deletes tracks/places Xs</li>
<li>Dragging either: places/delete markers of multiple tracks</li>
<li>Dragging both at same time: places multiple T markers</li>
</ul>
