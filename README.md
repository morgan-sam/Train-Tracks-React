<h3>How To Play</h3>
<p>The goal of the game is to create a train track path between the entrance and the exit of the board.</p>
<p>The path must have the same number of tracks in each row or column shown in the corresponding header.</p>
<p>
  <blockquote>If you place too many tracks a row/column will turn red.<br>
  If you place the right amount it will turn green.</blockquote>
</p>

<h3>Modes</h3>
<p>There are three map sizes: 6x6, 8x8 and 10x10.</p>
<p>There are 5 difficulty levels. Difficulties 3 and below are guaranteed a single correct solution, however difficulties 4 & 5 may require trial and error as there may be multiple possible solutions. Only one solution will be accepted. If you are stuck try using the <i>add hint track</i> button.</p>

<h3>Controls:</h3>

<p><blockquote>Hover over different parts of the tile to see what track you will place on left click.</blockquote></p>

<h3>To Do:</h3>

<p>Currently the game does not display properly on mobile. A mobile version would require a different control scheme as dragging does not work, and phone screens are too small to precisely press a section of a tile for a particular track type. The planned control scheme would be essentially the same as <a href='https://puzzlemadness.co.uk/traintracks/medium'>this</a>, with buttons for each individual track type.</p>
