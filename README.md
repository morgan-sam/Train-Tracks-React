<h2>Train Tracks Puzzle</h2>

<p>A React implementation of the train tracks puzzle.</p>

<p>Play <a href='https://morgan-sam.github.io/Train-Tracks-React/'>here</a>.</p>


<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>A train track that leads from 2 sides of the board is randomly generated, however there are missing tracks.</p>
<p>The number of tiles in row or column is shown on the top and right of the map. Create a track that links the entrance and exit that also fits the required number of tracks for each row and column.</p>
<p>If you place too many tracks a row/column will turn red, if you place the right amount it will turn green.</p>
<p>Once the 2 sides are linked and all rows/columns are satisfied, you win the game.</p> 

<h3>Modes</h3>
<p>There are three map sizes: 6x6, 8x8 and 10x10.</p>
<p>There are 5 difficulty levels. Difficulties 3 and below are guaranteed a single correct solution, however difficulties 4 & 5 may require trial and error as there may be multiple possible solutions. Only one solution will be accepted. If you are stuck try using the "add hint track" button.</p>

<h3>Placing Tracks</h3>
<p>You can place an X to mark a tile that has no tracks, and a T to mark a track where you don't know the type of rail used yet. Hover over different parts of the tile to see what track you will place on left click. </p>

<h3>Controls:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Left click: places tracks</li>
<li>Right click: deletes tracks/places Xs</li>
<li>Dragging either: places/deletes markers of multiple tracks</li>
<li>Dragging both at same time: places multiple T markers</li>
</ul>
